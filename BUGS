Suggestions:
 
* Batch-select blocks to move/delete?

* Screen resize feature (or maybe object resize)?
* Custom blocks (which can be created via the grid's right click menu)
* Right-click feature menu for the sidebar (delete, collapse, etc.)?

Grid bugs:

* can select all text (in blocks) by double-clicking it, right clicking, double-clicking it again (firefox)
    - "document.execCommand" doesn't work (line 337)
* can select text in the block's empty node (the one without a circle or an arrow on its right)
* right clicking on element titles freezes text selection (chrome/webkit)
* text in nodes can overlap the textbox if the block's inital body is small enough
* pressing spacebar in block's title makes the block's body a lot bigger than typing regular characters
* summoning any node besides "expression" breaks the right-click menu
* jsPlumb breaks whenever hotweb reloads the page

Sidebar bugs:

* Big declaration blocks sometimes don't swap places properly

Go bugs:
* Server port is still in use after suspending the application (ctrl+z)
